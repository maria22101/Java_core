Module 2 Project - Odds or Evens
********************************
For this project you are going to program a game called "Odds and Evens". 
The game is similar to rock paper scissors. It is played between two players, in your version it will be you versus the computer. 
Each player will choose either "odds" or "evens", since you’re playing the computer you will get first pick. 
Once you have chosen your side, you each choose a number of fingers to play- 0 to 5. 
--------------------------------
Part 1 - Pick odds or evens
Create a new java file called "OddsAndEvens".
Add a println that produces the following output:
Let’s play a game called “Odds and Evens”
Ask the user for their name and then use a scanner to let them type their name into the consol.
What is your name?
Now greet the user and ask them to choose either odds or evens. Use a scanner to let them type in either "O" or "E".
--------------------------------
Part 2 - Play the Game
Now you are going to be adding the actual game play to your game.
Ask the user how many "fingers" they are going to play, and let them enter in a number.
How many “fingers” do you put out?
Add the following code to your program to let the computer choose a random number to represent their fingers:
Random rand = new Random();
int computer = rand.nextInt(6);
Add a println that tells the user how many fingers the computer played.
The computer plays number "fingers".
Add another line of "-" characters to separate this part of your output from the results.
Now you need to determine what the results are.
Add the user’s number and the computer’s numbers together to get the sum.
Add a println that will print out the math to show the user.
Add another line of “-“ characters to end your program.
--------------------------------
Part 3 - Who won?
Now that we know the results, it’s time to decide who the winner is!
